# AntibodyAptamerGeneration

The aim of the project is to develop a model for the generation of aptamers. Aptamers are a promising alternative to antibodies due to their better reproducibility of results and ability to be stored at room temperature. The model will analyze the amino acid sequence of the antibody and the parameters of the target molecule, generating the optimal nucleotide sequence of the aptamer, which will simplify and accelerate their generation for medical and research applications
